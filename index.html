            <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive hot ball of plasma,
            inflated and heated by nuclear fusion reactions at its core. Part of this internal energy is 
            emited from the Sun's surface as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, providing most of
            the energy for life on Earth. The Sun's radius is about 695,000 kilometers (432,000 miles), or 
            109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, comprising about 99.86% 
            of the total mass of the Solar System.Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of
            hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements,
            including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.</p>
