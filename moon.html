            <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. Its diameter is about one-quarter of
            Earth's (comparable to the width of Australia), making it the fifth largest 
            satellite in the Solar System and the largest and most massive relative to its 
            parent planet. It is larger than all known dwarf planets in the Solar System.
            The Moon is a planetary-mass object with a differentiated rocky body, making it
            a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term. It lacks any
            significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is
            about one-sixth of Earth's at 0.1654 gâ€”Jupiter's moon Io is the only satellite 
            in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.</p>
